# Lab - HTML

## Part I: Accessibility Research and Review
Take some time to look through UK accessiblity guidelines  and to familiarise yourself with the requirements WACG 2.1.

- [Accessibility Requirements for Public Sector Websites and Apps](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps)
- [Understanding WCAG 2.1](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag)
- [BNTA Textbook: some notes on HTML-CSS-JS, Accessiblity and Responsive Design](https://brightnetwork-technology-academy.github.io/curriculum/html-css/Intro/)

## Part II: Create Your Own Website

Design a webpage or two using the workflow we suggest:
- write a short brief
- list the requirement for your page(s)
- use the crazy fours/eights technique to come up with some design ideas
- create a digital version of your website wireframe

Code your site using semantic HTML ONLY! Donâ€™t be tempted to add CSS or to embed functionality in the website. you will have a chance to add CSS to this site tomorrow.

Before you start, take a bit of time to look at the HTML tags available to you - there are probably more than you think. Check out the [Mozilla Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [HTML Cheatsheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/) for starters.
